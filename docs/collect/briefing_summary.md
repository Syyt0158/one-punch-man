# Hero Association Public Interface and Leaderboard


### Introduction

This document outlines the design and implementation of a Hero Leaderboard and Public Engagement Interface requested by the Hero Association’s Public Relations Department. The interface aims to connect heroes with society, fostering engagement and transparency.

### Section A: Hero Leaderboard Design

The digital leaderboard will update in real-time to reflect changes in hero rankings and achievements, categorizing heroes into recognition categories such as "Strongest Hero," "Most Popular Hero," and "Rising Star."

### Section B: Public Engagement Interface

The interface will include a public voting system influencing the “Most Popular Hero” category, allowing users to access hero profiles, view backgrounds, achievements, and duel history while protecting sensitive information.

### Section C: Privacy and Security Measures

Stringent data protection measures will be implemented to safeguard personal hero data, ensuring heroes have control over displayed information publicly and obtain consent for any shared data.

### Section D: Integration with Existing Systems

The new system will feature dynamic data updates reflecting real-time changes in hero data, including new registrations, profile updates, and duel outcomes, with seamless navigation between the leaderboard, hero profiles, and duel information.

### Conclusion

The Hero Leaderboard and Public Engagement Interface project aim to enhance the visibility of heroes’ valor and public involvement in their journeys, providing a real-time snapshot of hero standings and fostering a deeper connection between heroes and the public they serve.
